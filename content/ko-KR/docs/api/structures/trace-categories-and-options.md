# TraceCategoriesAndOptions 오브젝트

* `categoryFilter` String – 추적할 카테고리 그룹을 제어하는 필터. A filter can have an optional `-` prefix to exclude category groups that contain a matching category. Having both included and excluded category patterns in the same list is not supported. Examples: `test_MyTest*`, `test_MyTest*,test_OtherStuff`, `-excluded_category1,-excluded_category2`.
* `traceOptions` String - Controls what kind of tracing is enabled, it is a comma-delimited sequence of the following strings: `record-until-full`, `record-continuously`, `trace-to-console`, `enable-sampling`, `enable-systrace`, e.g. `'record-until-full,enable-sampling'`. 처음 3 가지이 trace recording 옵션은 상호 배타적입니다. If more than one trace recording modes appear in the `traceOptions` string, the last one takes precedence. If none of the trace recording modes are specified, recording mode is `record-until-full`. The trace option will first be reset to the default option (`record_mode` set to `record-until-full`, `enable_sampling` and `enable_systrace` set to `false`) before options parsed from `traceOptions` are applied on it.
